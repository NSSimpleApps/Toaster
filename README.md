where `center` is a center of `Toaster`.

`Toaster(topLeftCorner: CGPointMake(200, 200)).show("Tap to hide annoying view.")`
where `topLeftCorner` is a top left corner of `Toaster`.

`Toaster(toasterPosition: .CenterCenter).show("Tap to hide annoying view.")`
where `toasterPosition` is a center of main frame divided by 6 parts.
